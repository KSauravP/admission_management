It is inside the Complex of Alipore Command Hospital.Situated in the secure, green locales of the Command Hospital, Alipore, Kendriya Vidyalaya Command Hospital, Kolkata has become one of the most sought after elite schools of Kolkata, reasons being, the quality infrastructure, which is developed and upgraded from time-to-time. The facade of the building has received a new look with fresh paint.
    Apart from classroom teaching, our students have a big playground and an aesthetically manicured garden to enjoy open green space, which is a boon to our students, and is not available to some of the so called big schools.</p>
